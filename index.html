			<h2>Soy Candle</h2>
			<p>Candles made from soy wax are made from a natural wax made from soybeans. Since they are made with natural wax, they produce less soot and hold fragrance better. Soy candles offer long burning times and beautiful, fragrant light. </p>

				<h2>Scent</h2>
				<p>From floral and fruity to woodsy and spicy, soy candles come in a wide variety of scents. While some people prefer candles with strong, distinct fragrances, others prefer lighter, more subtle scents that blend well with their home's overall vibe.</p>
				<p>For instance, if you’re buying candles for a specific purpose, such as meditation or aromatherapy, you may want one with one dominant scent, like ylang-ylang, chamomile, or lavender. This will help to focus your mind and body on that particular effect. Similarly, if you plan on lighting up the candles during holidays or Christmas celebrations, opt for one that has a festive scent like cinnamon or pine.</p>

				<h2>Wick</h2>
				<p>The size and material of a candle’s wick can have a significant effect on how long it burns and how much fragrance it releases. The most common types of wicks used in soy candles are cotton core (cored) and braided. Cored wicks are made by winding cotton thread around a central core; braided wicks are made by twisting two or more strands of cotton together into one continuous cord.</p>
				<p>Cored wicks tend to be thinner than braided ones and produce less fragrance, but are also easier to trim as needed because they do not fray when cut (unlike braided ones). Braided wicks tend to burn brighter because there is less space between each fiber for heat to travel through, but produce more soot than their counterparts. Whatever type you choose, make sure to trim the wick before burning so it doesn’t flare up unexpectedly.</p>

				<h2>Candle Dyes</h2>
				<p>There are three types of candle dye in a large variety of colors: Dye Chips, Dye Blocks and Liquid Dyes.</p>
				<p>Dye chips work well for lighter, more pastel shades in soy, and light to medium shades in most paraffin. Dye blocks are better for darker, vibrant colors in soy, especially reds, greens, and blues. They can also be used to easily color large batches of paraffin wax. Liquid dyes will produce lighter, pastel shades in soy and light to dark shades in paraffin. These are also great for mixing to create custom colors..</p>
